# Sorting-Runtime-Comparison
Compares the runtime for different sorting algorithms
This project was doe for CS 4120 Algorithms class
The purpose of this project is to compare the runtime of various sorting algorithms:
 Quick sort
 Bubble sort
 Insertion sort
 Heap sort
 3 way merge sort

## compile with command like:
g++ main.cpp BubbleSort.cpp HeapSort.cpp InsertionSort.cpp MergeSort3.cpp number_data.cpp Quicksort.cpp

## run with command like:
./a.out

The data will be output into 8 different files in the same directory. The results of the tests will be output to the terminal
